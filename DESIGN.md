# Jules Haggard Website Design Context

## System

The current site is an intentional white editorial portfolio with giant Instrument Serif display typography, Instrument Sans body copy, sparse black CTAs, and large project media. This fork should preserve that identity while making Jules the clear first-viewport subject.

## Typography

- Display: Instrument Serif, used for brand name, large headlines, project titles, and case-study hero lines.
- Body: Instrument Sans, used for navigation, paragraphs, CTAs, metadata, and service lists.
- Case-study intro paragraphs should read as executive summaries, capped to a comfortable measure and visually subordinate to the headline.

## Layout

- Use generous whitespace and full-width media.
- Keep project pages anchored by a left strategy column and a right media column on desktop.
- On mobile, prioritize readable stacked content and stable spacing.
- Avoid nested cards, decorative gradients, or ornamental chrome.

## Motion

- Motion should feel like editorial pacing: subtle reveal, slight lift, clean timing.
- Animate transforms and opacity only.
- Respect `prefers-reduced-motion`.
- No bounce, elastic, or novelty effects.

## Color

- Preserve the restrained black-on-warm-white system.
- Use slightly tinted neutrals in new CSS overrides instead of pure black/white when possible.
- Project imagery carries most of the color.
- Avoid adding a new decorative palette for the personal fork.
